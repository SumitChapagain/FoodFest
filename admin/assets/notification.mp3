// This is a placeholder for the notification sound. 
// In a real scenario, this would be a binary .mp3 or .wav file.
// Since I cannot write binary files easily without hex encoding and the user environment might not support it fully via text tools,

// However, creating a dummy file to prevent 404 errors in the console and allow the logic to run.
// Use a data URI in the logic instead for reliability.
